[[CreateNGPServiceOfferInfo]]
=== Create NGP Service Offer Info

Endpoint to define and publish a new NGP service offer.

CPOs benefit from automation of the complex offer setup process that previously involved numerous manual inputs related to EVSE Networks and tariff groupings.
This reduces operational errors and increases speed-to-market when publishing new offers to HBS.

[[Dependencies]]
==== Dependencies:

1. EVSE Network API - required to structure offers by network and EVSE Groups;
2. Upload Terms and Conditions API - required to assign relevant legal documentation.

[[Endpoints]]
=== POST Endpoints:

- QA env: https://service-qa.hubject.com/api/partner/v1/operators/{operatorId}/service-offers
- PROD env: https://service.hubject.com/api/partner/v1/operators/{operatorId}/service-offers
